# Alumni Story Slider

A simple slider that displays a preview of viewable story content.

## Description

Using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript I created a slider that utilizes on click functions to control any action. The slider features one main image and four story-title buttons. When a new story-title button is selected, a fade-in effect is triggered and the main image is changed to the image corresponding with the button selected. Clicking on the main image will open a new window, navigating to the selected story. The slider is responsive to screen width and the layout will change for mobile views. 

## Getting Started
